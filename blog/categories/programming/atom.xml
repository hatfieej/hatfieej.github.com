    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I blame Bill Cosby.  It was his relentless advertising that convinced by grandfather to buy me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a> for the Christmas of '82.  You see, those machines booted up to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreter and came with a thick green programming manual (and a smaller blue one).  <img class="left" src="images/ti-beginners-basic.jpg" width="200" title="'The beginner''s manual'" > <img class="right" src="images/ti-users-reference.jpg" width="200" title="The big manual" > I was only 6, so I started with the blue one.  So, I proceeded to learn how to write "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world">Hello World</a>".  That was followed by "Hello <Name>" and "Guess the Number".  I soon realized that you could get "free" software for your computer typing line-by-line the BASIC code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computing">Family Computing magazine</a>.  These programs were not free.  If it wasn't caused by one of the many typos in the magazine, it was my own terrible six-year-old typing skills that caused an error in the program.  So, you learn to debug.  Before you know it, you're writing your own software.  Continue that trend and you end up with a Computer Science degree from <a href="http://www.rose-hulman/edu">some nerdy school in Indiana</a>.  So maybe it wasn't all Cosby's fault.  Maybe I had a natural love for software.</p>

<p>With the passing of Steve Jobs, I realize how much I admired him and his pursuit of great software.  When I'd start to fall out of love with software, he was always bringing me back with starry eyed visions of the future.  Each step was exciting.  Ahh, the Apple II...so simple.  The Mac...bringing GUIs and publishing to the masses.  The NeXT cubes and pizza boxes...they were the perfect blend of Mac and Unix (and the system that birthed the world's first web server).  Then there was the iMac and the reinvention of NeXTstep as OS X...computer systems were no longer beige and boring.  The iPod, iPhone and iOS...starting over, but this time it's mobile.  The devices were amazing, but it was the software that brought each one to life.  We still have a long way to go.  I'm pretty sure Steve's vision included more than birds in a slingshot and restaurant check-ins.  It's exciting to imagine where software will takes us next.  Steve, thanks for keeping my love alive.</p>
