    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can add pages anywhere in your blog source directory and they''ll be parsed by Jekyll.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The URL will correspond directly to the filepath, so about.markdown will become site.com/about.html. If you prefer the URL site.com/about/ you''ll want to create the page as about/index.markdown. Octopress has a rake task for creating new pages easily.</p>

<p>Like with the new post task, the default file extension is markdown but you can configure that in the Rakefile. A freshly generated page might look like this.</p>

<p>The title is derived from the filename so you''ll likely want to change that. This is very similar to the post yaml except it doesn’t include categories, and you can toggle sharing and comments or remove the footer altogether. If you don''t want to show a date on your page, just remove it from the yaml.</p>
